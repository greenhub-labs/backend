# <Module Name> Module

## Overview

Provide a high-level description of the module, its purpose, and its role within the system. Mention if it follows DDD, Clean Architecture, or any other architectural pattern.

---

## Architecture

- **Domain Layer**: Describe the core business logic, entities, value objects, and domain events.
- **Application Layer**: Explain the use cases, commands, queries, and their handlers.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: List the concrete implementations for repositories, caches, external services, etc.
- **Presenters Layer**: Detail how the module exposes its functionality (e.g., GraphQL, REST, events).

---

## Business Rules

- List the main business rules and constraints enforced by the module.
- Mention any invariants, validation logic, or special behaviors.

---

## Commands

- **<CommandName>Command**: Brief description of what the command does.
- Repeat for each command.

Describe the general flow for command handlers:

- Validation and processing
- Domain interaction
- Persistence
- Caching (if applicable)
- Event publication

---

## Queries

- **<QueryName>Query**: Brief description of what the query does.
- Repeat for each query.

Describe any caching or optimization strategies used.

---

## Events

### Domain Events

- **<DomainEventName>DomainEvent**: Description
- Repeat for each domain event.

### Integration Events

- **<IntegrationEventName>IntegrationEvent**: Description
- Repeat for each integration event.

---

## Event Handlers

- **<EventHandlerName>**: What event it handles and what it does.
- Repeat for each event handler.

---

## Integrations

- List and describe all external systems/services the module integrates with (e.g., databases, caches, message brokers, APIs).

---

## API/Resolvers

- List and describe all API endpoints, GraphQL resolvers, or event consumers/publishers exposed by the module.
- For each, specify:
  - Operation name
  - Type (Query/Mutation/Event)
  - Input/Output DTOs
  - Authentication/authorization requirements

---

## Security

- Describe security measures (e.g., authentication, authorization, data validation).
- Mention any role-based access or special restrictions.

---

## Extensibility

- Explain how the module can be extended (new commands, queries, events, integrations).
- Mention dependency injection or other extensibility mechanisms.

---

## Testing

- Describe the testing strategy for the module (unit, integration, e2e).
- Mention where tests are located and what is covered.

---

## How to Use

1. Steps to import and use the module in the main application.
2. How to interact with its API/resolvers/events.
3. Any configuration or environment variables required.

---

## Notes

- Any additional notes, caveats, or best practices for working with the module.
