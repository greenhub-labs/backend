## ðŸ“š Documentation Request

**Is your documentation request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what documentation is missing or insufficient. Ex. There is no README for the `[MODULE_NAME]` module, making it hard to understand or use.

**Describe the documentation you would like to see**
Please specify what should be included in the documentation. For a module, consider the following sections:

- **Module Overview**: Purpose, business/domain context, and how it fits into the overall architecture.
- **Architecture & Design**: Structure, main folders, DDD elements (aggregates, entities, value objects, repositories, services), and key design decisions.
- **Usage**: How to use the module (APIs, commands, queries, events), example flows, and extension/customization points.
- **Integration**: How to integrate with the rest of the backend, dependencies, configuration, and environment variables.
- **Domain Events & CQRS**: List and describe all domain events, commands, queries, and their handlers.
- **Testing**: How to run unit/integration tests, test structure, and conventions.
- **Troubleshooting & FAQ**: Common issues and solutions, further help.
- **Conventions & Best Practices**: Naming, folder structure, and architectural rules.
- **References**: Links to related docs, ADRs, or external resources.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Describe any alternative approaches to documentation (e.g., code comments, minimal docs) and why they are insufficient.

**Additional context**
Add any other context, screenshots, diagrams, or references that would help clarify the documentation needs. If possible, reference the overall project documentation style (see PROYECTO_GREENHUB_DOCUMENTACION.md).

**Impact**

- Who will benefit from this documentation?
